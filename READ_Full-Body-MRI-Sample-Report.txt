MRI BRAIN (PLAIN)

SAMPLE Normal features and signal intensities of both cerebral hemispheres including the cerebral cortex, white matter, and basal ganglia with normal midline structures. No significant signal alteration of the white matter. Diffusion weighted images; demonstrate no evidence of acute infarction. Normal  appearance  of  the  supra  and  infratentorial  ventricular  system,  basal cisterns, and cortical sulci. No space occupying lesions identified. No intra-cranial hemorrhage or extra axial fluid collection. No gross vascular anomalies identified. No mass effect; no midline shift. FINDINGS: Technique: Multiplanar multisequential imaging of the brain was performed without IV contrast administration.

Normal  posterior  fossa  structures  including  the  brainstem  and  the  erebellar hemispheres with maintenance of normal cervico-medullay junction. The cerebellar tonsils are normally situated.

Conclusion:

Essentially normal MRI study of the brain.
